    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",

      "In simple terms, an LLM is a type of **artificial intelligence (AI)** that is trained on a massive amount of text data. This training allows it to understand, generate, and manipulate human language in a sophisticated way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of what that means:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large:** This refers to two things:\n",
      "    *   **The size of the model itself:** LLMs have billions, sometimes trillions, of parameters (the internal variables that the model learns during training). This vast number of parameters allows them to capture complex patterns and nuances in language.\n",
      "    *   **The amount of data they are trained on:** LLMs are trained on enormous datasets, often encompassing a significant portion of the internet, books, articles, and other textual sources. This exposure to diverse language helps them learn grammar, facts, reasoning abilities, and different writing styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Language:** This is the core of what LLMs do. They are designed to process and produce human language. This includes:\n",
      "    *   **Understanding:** Comprehending the meaning of words, sentences, paragraphs, and even entire documents.\n",
      "    *   **Generating:** Creating new text that is coherent, grammatically correct, and contextually relevant. This can range from simple sentences to complex stories, poems, code, and more.\n",
      "    *   **Translating:** Converting text from one language to another.\n",
      "    *   **Summarizing:** Condensing long pieces of text into shorter, more digestible versions.\n",
      "    *   **Answering questions:** Providing informative responses to queries.\n",
      "    *   **Completing text:** Predicting and filling in missing words or phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Model:** In AI, a \"model\" is a mathematical representation of a system that has learned from data. For LLMs, this model is a complex neural network, often based on the **Transformer architecture**, which is particularly good at handling sequential data like text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a student who has read an entire library. They've absorbed countless stories, facts, and ways of expressing ideas. When you ask them a question or ask them to write something, they can draw upon all that knowledge to give you a relevant and well-formed response. An LLM is like that super-student, but on a vastly larger scale and with a much more structured learning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key characteristics and capabilities of LLMs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generative:** They can create new content.\n",
      "*   **Contextual:** They understand the meaning of words based on their surrounding text.\n",
      "*   **Versatile:** They can perform a wide range of language-related tasks.\n",
      "*   **Few-shot/Zero-shot learning:** They can often perform new tasks with very few or even no specific examples, relying on their general knowledge.\n",
      "*   **Emergent abilities:** As models get larger and are trained on more data, they sometimes develop surprising new capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of LLMs you might have encountered:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **GPT-3, GPT-4 (OpenAI):** The models behind ChatGPT.\n",

      "Of course! Here is a comprehensive explanation of what an LLM is, broken down for easy understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Simple Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, an LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that has been trained on a massive amount of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Think of it as a highly advanced autocomplete or a conversational \"brain\" that has read a significant portion of the internet, books, and other text sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Breaking Down the Name: \"Large Language Model\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look at each word to understand what it means:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large:** This refers to two things:\n",
      "    1.  **The amount of data it was trained on:** We're talking about terabytes of text, equivalent to millions of books.\n",
      "    2.  **The size of the model itself:** The \"size\" is measured in **parameters**, which are like the internal knobs and dials the AI uses to make decisions. Modern LLMs have billions or even trillions of parameters, allowing them to capture incredibly complex patterns in language.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Language:** The model's primary focus is human language. This includes understanding grammar, context, nuance, facts, reasoning styles, and even different languages and computer programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Model:** In AI, a \"model\" is a mathematical system or a complex algorithm that has been trained to perform a specific task. In this case, the task is to process and generate language by predicting the next most likely word in a sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Does It Work? (A Simplified Explanation)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Training:** An LLM is fed a vast dataset of text from the internet, books, articles, and more. It's not \"learning\" in the human sense; instead, it's identifying statistical patterns. It learns which words tend to follow other words, the structure of sentences, the relationships between concepts, and the rules of grammar.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **The Core Task: Prediction:** The fundamental goal during training is simple: **predict the next word**. Given the sentence \"The cat sat on the...\", the model learns to predict \"mat\" with a high probability, but also considers other possibilities like \"couch,\" \"floor,\" or \"rug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Emergent Abilities:** By training on this simple task at an enormous scale, LLMs develop surprising \"emergent\" abilities. They don't just predict the next word; they learn to:\n",
      "    *   Answer questions\n",
      "    *   Summarize long documents\n",
      "    *   Translate languages\n",
      "    *   Write computer code\n",
      "    *   Compose poetry and stories\n",
      "    *   Hold a coherent conversation\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### What Can LLMs Do? (Key Capabilities)\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are the technology behind many of the AI tools you see today. Their main capabilities include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Content Creation:** Writing emails, articles, marketing copy, and even creative fiction.\n",
      "*   **Question Answering:** Acting as a powerful search engine that provides direct, conversational answers.\n",
      "*   **Summarization:** Condensing long reports, articles, or meetings into key bullet points.\n",
      "*   **Translation:** Translating text between different languages with high accuracy.\n",
      "*   **Code Generation:** Writing code in various programming languages based on a natural language description.\n",
      "*   **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:** Powering sophisticated conversational agents like ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Popular Examples of LLMs\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **GPT Series (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)** by OpenAI (powers ChatGPT)\n",
      "*   **Gemini (formerly LaMDA and PaLM 2)** by Google (powers Google Bard/Gemini)\n",
      "*   **Claude** by Anthropic\n",
      "*   **Llama** by Meta AI\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Limitations to Remember\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs are powerful, but they are not perfect. Key limitations include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hallucinations:** They can confidently make up facts, sources, or details that are completely wrong. They are designed to sound plausible, not necessarily to be truthful.\n",
      "*   **Bias:** They can reflect and amplify biases present in their training data (e.g., stereotypes related to gender, race, or culture).\n",
      "*   **Lack of True Understanding:** They don't \"understand\" concepts or have consciousness like humans do. They are incredibly sophisticated pattern-matching machines.\n",
      "*   **Knowledge Cutoff:** Their knowledge is frozen at the time their training data was collected. They don't know about events that happened after that date unless they are specifically updated or connected to the live internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, an **LLM is a foundational technology in modern AI that has revolutionized how we interact with information and computers by enabling machines to master the complexities of human language.**\n"

      "\n",
      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",

      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "**Note:** You might see an `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error when running the following code all at once, this is because the `current API Rate Limit handling cannot reliably find out how many requests we have left per minute` from cell to cell, there is no Gemini feature created for it to get the information from their servers. So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
