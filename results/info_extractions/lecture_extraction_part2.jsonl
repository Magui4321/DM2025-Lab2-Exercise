And then sometimes in certain place, we will also talking about the resolution. And that part about sparsity, how to solving them, how to do the resolution, we will talking about that later in some of the courses, some of them will be in classification, some of them will be in the text mining.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Characteristics of Data Sets\". It lists three characteristics: Dimensionality, Sparsity, and Resolution. Under Sparsity, it notes \"Only presence counts\" and \"Patterns depend on the scale\". A speech bubble with \"Later\" is drawn next to Sparsity.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Types of Data Sets\". It lists three types: Data Matrix, Document Data, and Transaction Data.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 112:58]\nSo we want to talk about different type of the data set. We have the data matrix, document data, transaction data. So data matrix look like this way. If your data can be convert into meaningful number, they can become data metric. Most of the data are in numerical attribute and then we allow them to do the ratio operation. To make sure all the value inside need to become the ratio data. If it's not, then right here they need to be ratio data.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Data Matrix\". It states that a data matrix is applicable if each object has the same fixed set of numeric attributes.", "document_id": "doc_4f0b000e"}
