animation \nDeath and fascism may not seem ideal subjects for a life-affirming fantasy animation for \ngrownup children of all ages. Yet Mexican maestro Guillermo del Toro, whose 2017 \nmasterpiece The Shape of Water won the Oscar for best picture, brings his monstrous \ncinematic skills to bear on Carlo Collodi’s timeless fable with miraculous results, turning it \ninto a Mussolini-era parable about a “lethal form of control and paternity”. Using the tactility \nof stop-motion animation to lend splintery weight (both physical and emotional) to the story. \nAlong with co-writer Patrick McHale (Matthew Robbins gets a “screen story” credit), Del Toro \nresituates Collodi’s source in the between-the-war years of the 20th century. Carpenter \nGeppetto (voiced by David Bradley) has lost his beloved son, Carlo, in the Great War. One \nnight, drunk on grief, he cuts down the tree by Carlo’s grave and builds a ramshackle puppet \n(Gris Grimly’s illustrations provide structural inspiration) to replace his lost child. When a blue \nspirit breathes life into the puppet, Geppetto is initially terrified of the whirling dervish \nunleashed in his home. But the pair soon settle down, with Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) \nhelping Geppetto repair the huge crucified Christ that hangs like a tortured marionette in the \nchurch where congregants shriek about demonic puppets. “Everybody likes him,” says \nPinocchio, pointing up at what looks like a prop from Ken Russell’s The Devils (1971). “He’s \nmade of wood too. Why do they like him and not me?” \nYes, Pinocchio is bequeathed a conscience in the form of a talking cricket, a character who \n(let us not forget) Pinocchio killed with a hammer early on in Collodi’s original. But Ewan \nMcGregor’s narrator Sebastian J Cricket is no pious stooge; nor is the Fairy with the \nTurquoise Hair (whom Collodi also declares dead) a beneficent bestower of “real boy” \nhuman status. Instead, she is a multi-eyed Wood Sprite (Tilda Swinton) with one foot in the \ngrave, whose underworld alter ego tells Pinocchio that the only path to life is (guess what?) \ndeath – the very thing that gives life value. \nWhile it’s tempting to compare this version of Pinocchio with Matteo Garrone’s 2019 labour \nof love, there’s a closer bond with Steven Spielberg’s still underrated 2001 sci-fi fantasy AI: \nArtificial Intelligence. Like Spielberg, Del Toro is fascinated by the Frankenstein elements of \na story in which monsters are not what they seem, and the attainment of “humanity” is \nportrayed as a flawed venture that must be solved through narrative poetry rather than \nphysical transformation. Both directors also embrace the surreal visual spectacle of a story \nthat sends its characters into the belly of the beast via grotesquely gaping jaws, with Del \nToro also cheekily tipping his hat towards Spielberg’s most explosive creature feature. \nYet ultimately, it’s the film’s sheer strangeness – that peculiarly magical, lapsed-Catholic \nsensibility that runs throughout all of Del Toro’s most personal works – that makes this sing \nand fly.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_799e14eb"}
